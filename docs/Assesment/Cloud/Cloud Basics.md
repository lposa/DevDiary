# What is Cloud Computing?

- Delivery of computing services such as databases, APIs, etc.. across the internet.

# Cloud Service Models

1. On premise - User Managed
2. IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service
3. PaaS - Platform as a Service
4. Saas - Software as a Service

# Pizza as a service module

1. On Premises - making your pizza at home, meaning you are responsible for all of the steps creating and serving the pizza
2. Take and Bake - Iaas - here you get all the ingredients from the provider, and you only need  to cook it and serve it, provide resources as fire, oven, dining table...
3. Pizza Delivery - PaaS - here the provider will give you the pizza ready to be eaten, and you will only provide the dining
4. Dine Out - SaaS - restaurant provides all services, you only need to consume the pizza

# IaaS

- Quickly scales up and down with demand, letting you pay only for what you use
- Helps you avoid expense and complexity of buying and managing your own physical servers and other datacenter infrastructures
- Each resource is offered as a seperate service component, and you only need to rent a particular one for as long as you need it
- A cloud computing service provider, manages the infrastructure, while you purchase, install, configure, and manage your own software, OS, middleware and applications


## Common IaaS business scenarios

- Test and development
- Website hosting
- Storage, backup, and recovery
- Web Applications
- High performance computing
- Big Data Analysis

## Advantages of IaaS

- Eliminates capital expense and reduces ongoing cost
- Improves business continuity and disaster recovery
- Innovate rapidly
- Responds quicker to shifting business conditions
- Focus on your core business
- Increase stability, reliability and supportability
- Better security
- Gets new apps to users faster


## Most Popular Providers

1. AWS
2. Azure
3. GCP

# PaaS

- A complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, with resources that enable you to deliver everything from a simple cloud-based app to sophisticated, cloud-enabled enterprise applications.
- PaaS includes not only infrastructures like servers, storage, and networking but also middleware, development tools, business intelligence services, database management systems and more
- Is designed to support the complete web application lifecycle: building, testing, deploying, managing, and updating
- Helps you avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing your own physical infrastructure, middleware, container orchestrator, development tools
- You as the customer, manage the application and services you develop, and the cloud service provider manages everything else.

## Common PaaS Scenarios

- API development and management
- Business analytics/intelligence
- Business process management (BPM)
- Communications (voice, video, messaging)
- Databases as a Service
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Master data management (MDM)

## Advantages of PaaS

- Same as IaaS plus more such as:
1. Cut Coding time
2. Add development capabilities without adding stuff
3. Develop for multiple platforms more easily
4. Use sophisticated tools affordably
5. Support geographically distributed development teams
6. Efficiently manage the application lifecycle

## Most popular PaaS providers

1. Salesforce
2. GCP
3. Heroku
4. AWS
5. Azure

# SaaS 

- Allows users to connect to cloud-based apps and use them over the internet
- You rent the use of an app for your organization, and your users connect to it over the Internet, usually with a web browser or mobile app
- SaaS allows your organization to quickly get and run an application at minimal upfront cost
- The service provider manages the hardware and software, and with the appropriate service agreement, will ensure the availability and the security of the app and your data as well


## Advantages of SaaS

1. Accessibility - easy to run on any device, OS, browser
2. Updates and Patches
3. Hardware 
4. Market Reach - access services not normally available
5. Saving and Storage
6. Data and Analytics

## Top SaaS providers

1. Salesforce - largest!
2. Slack
3. GCP
4. AWS
5. Dropbox


# Cloud Computing Deployment

- Public
- Private
- Hybrid

## Public 

- All the resources needed to run the infrastructure are owned and managed by the third-party provider and accessed by your users over the Internet via a web browser
- AWS, Azure, GCP are all public
- Multi-tenant - you share the infrastructure with others
- Lower cost
- Freedom from maintenance 
- On-demand scalability
- High reliability
- Reduced complexity
- Flexible pricing options
- Challenges/Disadvantages: 
1. Security 
2. A poor fit for sensitive and confidential workloads
3. High expense

## Private 

- Private cloud is a computing infrastructure devoted to use by a single organization
- Good security
- Regulatory compliance 
- Scalability
- High performance
- Flexibility to respond to changing needs
- Challenges/Disadvantages:
1. High CAPEX and overhead - more expensive
2. Maintenance cost - very high cost
3. Deployment and Support - organizations require qualified people for this
4. Scalability limitations

## Hybrid

- A cloud computing environment that uses a mix of on-premises, private cloud and third-party, public cloud services with orchestration between the two platforms
- Hybrid clouds combine the public and private cloud resources to yield the advantages of both
- Gives business greater flexibility and more data deployment options
- Unlike public clouds, a private cloud is  not share with anyone else
- Compliance and security
- High flexibility
- Resource optimization
- Ease and agility
- High reliability
- Challenged/Disadvantages:
1. Elevated cost
2. Infrastructure complexity

# Which one to choose?

- Small business go for a public cloud, while bigger business go for private ones.
- Public are good for: 
1. Predictable computing needs
2. Applications and services critical for IT and business operations
3. Reserve resources provisioned to meet peak usage situations on demand
4. Software development and test environments

- Private clouds are good for: 
1. Highly-regulated industries and government agencies
2. Technology companies that require strong control and security over their IT workloads and underlying infrastructure
3. Organizations with the resources and requirements to invest in advanced technologies delivering the highest performance and availability

- Hybrid clouds are good for:
1. Enterprises serving multiple vertical markets with different IT security, regulatory and performance requirements
2. Optimizing the overall cloud investment while leveraging the advantages of both public and private
3. Provided enhanced security for solutions such as SaaS workloads


# Cloud Computing Challenges

1. Security
2. Managing Cloud Spend
3. Governance
4. Lack of resources and expertise
5. Compliance
6. BYOL - bring your own license
7. Managing Multi Cloud
8. Cloud Migration
