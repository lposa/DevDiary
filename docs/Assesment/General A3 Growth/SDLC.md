# SDLC Methodologies

## Waterfall model

### When to use:

- Requirements are not changing frequently
- Application is not complicated and big
- Project is short
- Requirement is clear
- Environment is stable
- Technology and tools used are not dynamic and is stable
- Resources are available and trained


## Difference between Agile and Waterfall

### Waterfall:
- Waterfall model follows a linear and sequential approach â€“ hence it's also known as Sequential Model. Each phase must be completed before you can move on to the next phase. There's no room for changes or error fixing once a phase is completed.
- This model is straightforward and easier to understand and use.
- A key benefit of this model is that its rigidity allows for meticulous record-keeping and documentation.
- However, its biggest drawback is that it does not handle revisions and modifications well, which might potentially result in product deficiencies and customer dissatisfaction.
### Agile:
- Agile, on the other hand, is an iterative and incremental approach to software development and project management. It focuses on delivering small, functional portions of the product, prioritising customer satisfaction and team collaboration.
- Agile methodology is adaptive and flexible. Changes are expected and welcomed in this method. It promotes regular communication and feedback between team members and customers.
- One key advantage of Agile is its emphasis on customer satisfaction by delivering functional software quickly and regularly.
- However, the lack of a thoroughly defined plan and the dependence on customer and team communication can lead to project scope creep if not managed properly.


- Waterfall Project Example: Suppose we're working on a project to construct a building. This kind of project suits the Waterfall model very well. The requirements (like the architectural designs, building layout, number of rooms etc.) are well known upfront and rigid. The phases in this project might include: Design, Construction, Painting, and Finishing. Each phase is executed one after another and there's seldom a need to revisit an earlier phase. Hence, the waterfall model works well for this project.

- Agile Project Example: Consider developing a new software application for an evolving technology like augmented reality (AR) shopping. In such a project, the requirements are likely to change often as technology, customer preferences, and shopping trends evolve. Agile is suitable for such a project as it allows for iterative development and continuous feedback. The project can start with some basic features of the AR app and then, based on user feedback, new features can be added or existing ones modified in subsequent iterations. Agile allows adaptation according to the changing needs of the project.
