# What ES6 Brought In Comparison To Older Versions

ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, brought many significant improvements over ES5, making JavaScript development easier and more efficient.

## Key Features Introduced in ES6:

### 1. `let` and `const`

ES6 introduced `let` and `const` as new ways to declare variables. `let` is block-scoped, and `const` is block-scoped but cannot be reassigned.

### 2. Arrow Functions

Arrow functions provide a new, shorter syntax for declaring functions. They also don't have their own `this` value.

```javascript
const square = (x) => x * x;
```

#### 3. Template Literals

Template literals allow embedded expressions and multi-line strings.

```javascript
const name = 'John';
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
```

### 4. Destructuring Assignment

Destructuring allows unpacking values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.

```javascript
const {name, age} = person;
```
### 5. Spread Operator

The spread operator is a quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a functionâ€™s arguments.

```javascript
const arr1 = [1, 2];
const arr2 = [...arr1, 3, 4]; // arr2 becomes [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### 6. Promises

Promises simplify deferred and asynchronous computations, representing an operation that hasn't completed yet but is expected in the future.

### 7. Classes

Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.

### 8. Modules

JavaScript modules are a way to share and reuse code across a JavaScript project.


## CSS3 and its Advancements over CSS2

CSS3 is the latest version of the CSS specification. CSS3 introduces many new features and improvements over CSS2.

### Key Features Introduced in CSS3:

1. **Rounded Corners**
   CSS3 introduced the `border-radius` property, which is used to add rounded corners to an element.

2. **Box Shadows**
   The `box-shadow` property is used to add shadow effects around an element's frame.

3. **Gradients**
   CSS3 introduced gradients, which allow you to display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors.

4. **2D/3D Transforms**
   The 2D transform property is used to rotate, move, skew, and scale elements. 3D transforms are similar to 2D transforms but with added depth.

5. **Animations**
   With CSS3, web designers can create animations and transitions without the use of JavaScript or Flash.

6. **Flexbox Layout**
   Flexbox layout is a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container.

7. **Responsive Design with Media Queries**
   CSS3 introduced media queries, which allow developers to create different layouts for different screen sizes, resolutions and devices.

8. **New Selectors**
   CSS3 introduced new selectors such as attribute selectors, child selectors, and sibling selectors, which offer more flexibility in targeting elements to style.
