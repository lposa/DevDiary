# HTTP2

HTTP/2 is the latest version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and comes with several improvements over its predecessor HTTP/1. Here are a few reasons why enabling HTTP/2 can optimize network communication:

1. Multiplexing: HTTP/2 allows multiple requests and responses to be sent at the same time over a single TCP connection. This is a significant improvement over HTTP/1, where each request-response pair requires a separate TCP connection. This can drastically reduce the latency, improve page load speeds, and make more efficient use of network resources.

2. Server Push: HTTP/2 introduces server push, where a server can send additional cacheable information to the client that it anticipates the client will need, reducing the number of requests a client has to make.

3. Header Compression: HTTP/2 uses HPACK compression, which reduces overhead. It can compress large headers and also eliminates duplicate headers in the process.

4. Binary Protocol: While HTTP/1 is a text-based protocol, HTTP/2 is a binary protocol, which makes it more efficient to parse, more compact and less error-prone.

5. Flow Control: HTTP/2 allows receivers to throttle the sender, ensuring that the sender doesn't overwhelm the receiver with data that it may not want or might not be ready to process.

6. Prioritization: HTTP/2 allows client browsers to indicate request priority to a server, helping ensure that high-priority requests (like critical CSS, JS, above-the-fold assets) are downloaded and delivered more quickly than non-critical resources.

Enabling HTTP/2 can improve web performance, reduce the amount of bandwidth used, and make web applications more responsive. However, as with any technology, whether HTTP/2 will be beneficial depends on the specific application and network conditions.
