# CSP - Content Security Policy

CSP stands for Content Security Policy. It's a security measure used in web development to help prevent attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.

Basically, it's a way for a website to tell the browser what actions it is allowed to perform, and what should be considered suspicious. It is a way for a website to restrict and control resources a browser is allowed to load like images, scripts, CSS, etc.

For instance, it can specify that all content must come from a specific domain, or that inline scripts are not allowed to run.

The policy is set using the Content-Security-Policy meta-tag in the HTML of the webpage or a specific HTTP header from the server.

Imagine it's like a bouncer at a club's door, only the trusted or approved parts may enter, keeping the unwanted behavior out.
