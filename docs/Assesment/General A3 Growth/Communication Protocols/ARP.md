# ARP Protocol

**ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** is used in the Internet Protocol (IP) suite. Its primary function is mapping an IP address to a physical or MAC address on a local network. Mostly, ARP is leveraged to find the link layer or hardware address (like a MAC address) using an IP address that's known.

Whenever a device on a network plans to send a data packet to another device, it needs the target device's MAC address. If only the IP address of the recipient is known to it, ARP is used to find the corresponding MAC address. It does this by broadcasting an ARP request to all devices on the network. The device having a matching IP address responds with its MAC address.

Here's a straightforward breakdown of ARP protocol at work:

1. **Device A** plans to send a packet to **Device B**. However, **Device A** only knows **Device B's** IP address.
2. **Device A** broadcasts an ARP request onto the network. The message is something like, "Who possesses this IP address?"
3. Although all devices on the network receive the request, only **Device B** responds because the IP address matches its own.
4. **Device B** then sends an ARP reply back to **Device A** including its MAC address.
5. On receiving the ARP reply, **Device A** can now transmit packets to **Device B** using its MAC address. The details of IP to MAC mapping received by **Device A** are stored in its ARP cache for future use.

ARP protocol is integral to the proper functioning of networks. It works as a translator between the Network Layer (known for IP addresses) and the Data-Link Layer (known for MAC addresses).
