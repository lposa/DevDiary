# Monorepo

A **monorepo (mono repository)** is a code management and architectural concept whereby you store all of your code in a single repository. This includes multiple projects, libraries, and applications, regardless of the programming language or purpose they serve.

## Characteristics of a Monorepo:

- **Single Repository**: All code is stored in a single repository. This includes libraries, APIs, frontend applications, backend applications, etc.

- **Shared Code**: Code can be easily shared and reused across projects.

- **Simplified Dependency Management**: Managing dependencies is often easier in a monorepo since all projects use a single, consistent version of each dependency.

- **Collaboration and Code Reviews**: Since all code resides in the same repository, collaboration and code reviews are often easier due to lack of boundaries between teams.

- **Unified Versioning**: A single repository means that there is only one source of truth. Every commit can affect any project, which means versioning happens across all projects.

Large tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter use monorepos to manage their massive codebases.

However, monorepos are not a silver bullet. They come with their own set of challenges such as more complex tooling, scalability issues with traditional version control systems, longer testing and build times, and the potential for more merge conflicts.
