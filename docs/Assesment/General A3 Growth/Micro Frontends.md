# Micro Frontends

- Micro frontends is an architectural style inspired by the microservices concept. The general idea behind micro frontends is to extend the concept of microservices to the frontend world.

- Generally, in a monolithic frontend application, all aspects of the front-end (like displaying product listings, user profile information, search, shopping cart etc.) are bundled into a single scalable project. However, with the growth of application this soon becomes very complex and difficult to manage, allocate development work or add new features.

- Instead, with a micro frontend architecture, the frontend codebase is broken up into "micro" applications. Each micro application can be developed, tested, and deployed independently by different teams with different technology stacks.

- Here are a few characteristics defining Micro Frontends:

1. Independent Development and Deployment: Each micro frontend can be developed, tested, and deployed independently by different teams. This allows for more agility and speed in development and updates.

2. Isolated Code: Each micro frontend has its own distinct and isolated code base. This allows teams to make choices on tools and technologies without impacting others.

3. Composition: Each micro frontend is part of a larger application, which can be composed by pulling together these various micro frondends.

4. Inter-communication: Individual micro frontends may need to communicate amongst each other in order to maintain synchronicity and coherence.

- Many global businesses like Amazon, Spotify, and IKEA make use of micro frontend principles in order to have multiple teams working efficiently on large applications. However, with this structure also comes trade-offs, including complexity of co-ordinating multiple teams and potential inconsistencies between different parts of the application. Organizations must fully consider the pros and cons before deciding to adopt a micro frontend architecture.
