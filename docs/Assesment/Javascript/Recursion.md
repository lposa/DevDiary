## Martin and the dragon

- Martin gets a task to go talk to the dragon.
- He gets a list numbers, and he needs to find out if any one those numbers are odd.
- Excuse me Mr. Dragon? Can you tell me if any one these numbers are odd?
- Dragon is angry, he says I'm sorry boy, I will only tell you if the first number in that list is odd.
- The boy thinks then, and comes up with a solution. Goes to the dragon, gives him the list. 
- Dragon says not odd. Martin comes back, gives him a new list, it's not odd. And so on.
- At the end of the list, Martin gives the dragon an empty list and the dragon says: THATS AN EMPTY LIST YOUR MORON.
- Martin then says: Aha! So all the numbers on the list were even!

## What is recursion?

- A process that calls itself. 
- There has to be some endpoint, so we don't go into an infinite loop. 
- Examples: `JSON.parse/JSON.stringify`, `document.getElementByID` , `DOM traversal algorithms`, `Object traversal`
