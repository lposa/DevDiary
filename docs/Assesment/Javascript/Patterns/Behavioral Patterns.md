# Behavioral Patterns

- Improving communications between objects.

## Observer Pattern

- Maintain a list of objects based on events, and updating data based on these events.
- Example: Car class, we have an observer of the fuel level, notify the fuel level.
- Publish and Subscribe is something YouTube is using.

## State Pattern

- Very popular with React.
- When value changes, causes a re render of the app/page.

## Chain of Responsibility

- Example: buying something. Logged in? Address? Calculate taxes? Shipping? Process Payment?
- This above is a chain

## Iterator Pattern

- Best used in a for loop.
- Looping through objects.

## Strategy Pattern

- Encapsulate different algorithms and functions and later use them in different scenarios.
- Creating instances is an example. We encapsulated a class, and then use it to create new objects.

## Memento Pattern

- Providing temporary state of an object. 
- Example: serialization

## Mediator Pattern

- Set of objects that interact with each other mostly by having 1 central authority dictating the terms.

## Command Pattern

- Example: Redux.
