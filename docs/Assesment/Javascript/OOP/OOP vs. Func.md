# OOP VS FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING


### Functional programming 

- Pure functions - output of our functions should only depend on its input.
- Function code should produce no side effects.
- Functional code is stateless, which means data is immutable

### OOP Programming

- Clear set of statements to create something
- We can mutate data, using setters, different functions
- Static methods
- Polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance
