# Express.js

## What is Express.js?

- A Node.js framework - a package that adds a bunch of utility functions and tools and a clear set of rules on how the app should be build.
- Highly extensible and other packages can be plugged into it.

## Middleware

- Any request gets funneled through multiple functions that do something with that requests. These functions are called middleware.
- These functions can also be third party packages.
