# What is Node.js?

- It's a Javascript Runtime. It enables us to run Javascript outside the browser. It runs Javascript on a "server", or anywhere else that is not a browser.
- Node.js uses V8, the JS engine. This engine takes the JS Code, and compiles it to machine code.
- Some extra features are for example the file system, which is not available on the browser. 

# Understanding the Role and Usage of Node.js

- We can also use it for Utility Scripts, Build Tools and actually use it a lot in React
- Write the code that is the server and that runs the Server. Create Server & listen to incoming requests.
- Business Logic: Handle Requests, Validate Inputs, Connect to Database
