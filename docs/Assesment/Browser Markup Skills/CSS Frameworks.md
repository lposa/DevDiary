### CSS Frameworks

## Bootstrap vs. Tailwind

- Bootstrap is a UI component library, i.e. the end product is a pre-styled button following Bootstrap's design system.

- Tailwind is a CSS utility library, i.e. the end product is a set of schematically defined CSS classes for you to build your own button schematically.
