# AI Generated Situations 

1. **How would you handle a difficult teammate?**  
   "I would ensure that we have clear and open communication. If their behavior continues to negatively impact the work or the team, I would address the issue directly, but politely and privately, using specific examples. If the behavior continues, I would escalate the issue to management following the company's protocol."

2. **What would you do if you strongly disagreed with the technical approach your manager/superior wants to take on a project?**  
   "I would present my arguments with clear reasoning and data to my manager privately. Sometimes different perspectives can lead to better solutions. It's important to express your viewpoint, but also accept the decision that is eventually taken."

3. **How would you handle a task/project you're assigned but have no idea how to start/complete?**  
   "I would first research as much as I can to gain an understanding of the task. If I still feel lost, I would reach out to colleagues or supervisors for assistance. There's no shame in asking for help; we're all on the same team and are working toward the same goals. The important thing is not to let the task sit idle."

4. **What if your teammate consistently misses deadlines and it affects your work?**  
   "I would first speak directly with them to understand if there are factors that are causing these delays. If it continues, I would bring this to the attention of the project manager or team lead, as it's impacting my ability to do my work. I would present them with specific examples of when and how my work was affected."

5. **How would you handle a situation where you become aware of a very serious bug in a product, but it's the night before a major release?**  
   "I would immediately inform my manager and the QA team lead. Despite the timing, it's crucial to ensure that we release a quality product. Depending on the severity of the bug, it could be more detrimental to release the product with the bug, rather than delaying the release."
