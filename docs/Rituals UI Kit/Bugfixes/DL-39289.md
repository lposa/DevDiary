## TODO:

1. Breadcrumbs on mobile not aligned correctly - this was already fixed
2. Chevron on the left should be optional - I don't understand this one
3. The animation for hover is still occurring - not a bug, QA misunderstood the point
4. The Default and FAQ Wimo Page modal urls are not working - fixed, type in https, was htps. 
5. When there is only one option in the breadcrumb path, it’s not allowing that to be clickable, for example for Legal pages we will only show users “Go back to Homepage” on Desktop / “Home” on Mobile, so that needs to be clickable. - new feature
