# DL-37324 

## [BUG] [Redesign Header] When clicking on search icon on mobile dropdown is too much zoomed in (SFCC/REACT)

## Problems I faced during this ticket: 

- It was a bit hard to find what was causing this issue. 
- After some investigation, I found out that Safari devices zoom in the website if an inputs font size is less than 16px.

## How I solved this issue:

- Added a `isSafari` boolean check to the search input, and adjusted its font size to be `17px`
