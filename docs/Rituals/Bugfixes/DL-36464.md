## [BUG][Redesign | FAQ & WIMO | WIMO Order Status] Wrong status for delivered order

- Link to ticket: https://rituals.atlassian.net/browse/DL-36464

## Issues I faced:

- A bit harder to read the code and find correct order statuses, as they were all messed up. But we requested new ones.

## How I solved this issue:

1. Simplified the code in the `ProgressStepper.tsx`, by exchanging the chained ternary operators to a switch/case to increase readability.
2. Verified that the actual issue here are the wrong responses coming from EVA. This was a click and collect order in the ticket, and the statuses came as `order delivered`, instead of `order pickup` and so on..
3. Changed helpers in the `WimoOrderStatusPage`, since the wrong ones were being used. `getContentfulResourceFields` is the one needed to be used when we expect back a string, `getContentfulFieldValue` is the one we need to use if we want a CF object back.
