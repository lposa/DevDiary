## Problems I faced:

- These were animations, to which I am not that used to, so it was a bit hard to understand all of the values used.

## How I solved it: 
1. For the dot loader animation, we already have a component for that `<LoaderDots/>`, although, I did modify it to make it more global.
2. Exchanged the animated circle div into an svg and adjusted the animation for it. 
3. The spinning circle animation was the hardest. I had to completely rewrite the animation that was on it before and to use a svg instead of the FA Icon.
