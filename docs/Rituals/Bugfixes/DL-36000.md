#  [Navigation | React] Third level of navigation is not showing for "New" and "Collections"

## Issues: 

1. So, when I go to https://app.contentful.com/spaces/eq2choccwqhs/environments/acc/entries/3b4QrRTlMGIUdBkzhyXBsF?previousEntries=2YCgtFUUhtGBtMcZd271SK%2C77W9jLIkVpRUvAhT23jBeU&focusedField=title,
this item has a Title resource which value is `Limited`. This doesn't match the title we compare it to in the `renderSubcategories` in `SubCategories.tsx` file.
2. If I remove the said resource, the content shows up. 
3. Pre-requisites for the third-level navbar to open is to have the `isSection` as false for the `SubNavigation` item, and it seems like we need to have a `shop all` or `discover all`?
4. Everything from above is just a special case, the collections have to have a whole complete different way of working. Ayelen will set it up for me.

## Fix
- After consulting with the team, we had a meeting and setup the correct CF content, so I worked from that. It wasn't a content issue, but we were missing the way of working with nested `menu_items`.
- Added the code for it, tried not to modify the existing code too much, so that we don't overcomplicate the already complicated code.
