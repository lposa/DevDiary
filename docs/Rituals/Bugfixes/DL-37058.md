## [BUG] [Redesign Homepage] Header + category carousel header glitching on mobile

- Link to ticket: https://rituals.atlassian.net/browse/DL-37058
- Link to PR: https://bitbucket.org/rituals/rituals-headless/pull-requests/1448

## Problems I faced:

### Train of thought

- This is a hard one. Reproducing the issue was hard, because it was only happening on iOS.
- The problem seems to be withing the `InterSectionObserver` and its `rootMargin` property.
- I need better understanding of the `rootMargin`
- This was happening only on Safari. The `intersection observer` we are using is not working perfectly with Safari devices.
- I created an useEffect instead for checking if element is in view.

## How I sovled it: 

```typescript jsx
useEffect(() => {
    const handleScroll = () => {
        const rect = secondSwiperWrapperRef?.current?.getBoundingClientRect();
        if (rect) {
            const isVisible = rect.bottom > 0 && rect.top < 0;
            setIsCarouselVisible(isVisible);
        }
    };

    window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
    handleScroll();

    return () => window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
}, []);

```

## Still glitching:

- First thought is maybe navbar is making it glitch. But, no. Tried display none but that didn't work,
- Tried with different top styling, but top is not the issue either.

## FIX

1. Added sticky styling instead of fixed (fixed does not work the same on Safari)
2. Added `throttle` to the `handleScroll()`. This reduces the amount of time the function get called.
