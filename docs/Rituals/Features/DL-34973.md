## [Redesign  My Account] Update validation of order status fetch from RGC response

- Link to ticket: https://rituals.atlassian.net/browse/DL-34937

## Problems I faced:
- None really. Was a bit unclear in the ticket and some order statuses were missing from the ticket, but was solved with BAs.



### How I implemented it:

1. Added the new CF resources
2. Fetched them in `OrderOverview.tsx`
3. Created a constant with the order status keys, called `ORDER_STATUS_KEYS`, these match the order statuses we get from RGC.
4. I am using this constant to create an object with keys from `ORDER_STATUS_KEYS`, with the correct CF resource. 
5. ~~Passing this object down to `OrderOverviewHistory.tsx`~~
6. ~~Created a function `mapOrderStatus`, that accesses the object using the `order.status` we get from RGC as a key.~~
7. Points 5 and 6 are changed, because I realised that `OrderOverviewHistory.tsx` is being used on multiple places, so that way we would have to create the resource object every time we use it and then pass it. Instead, I moved everything to the `OrderOverviewHisoty.tsx` component.
8. We are now creating the object in the `OrderOverviewHistory.tsx`, mapping and calling CF values. 

BONUS: Fixed an issue where opening one `OrderOverviewHistory` item, would result in another item under the same index, being opened on other pages. To fix this, I changed the `key`
in the `.map()` to not just be index, but `index - pageNumber`.
