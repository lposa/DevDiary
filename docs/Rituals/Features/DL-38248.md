# [Redesign | FAQ & WIMO | WIMO Order Status] Placeholder images for google maps

- Link to ticket: https://rituals.atlassian.net/browse/DL-38248

## Issues I faced during this ticket: 

- It was a bit unclear how to use static images on our project.
- To do so, need to import `import {getAssetUrl} from '@salesforce/pwa-kit-react-sdk/ssr/universal/utils'`
- Then we use it to create the image src such as `const googleMapsFallbackImage = getAssetUrl('static/img/google-maps-fallback.jpg')`
- And then just use it as a src in an img tag.

## Solving the issue:

- First steps explained above.
- Did some minor styling.
