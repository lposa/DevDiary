# DL-36278

## [Redesign | FAQ & WIMO | WIMO Order Status] Content in the banner title should come from CF

## Issues I faced: 

- A bit harder to clarify which statues we need to which title, but got it at the end
- Testing took long, because EVA wasn't fast enough with the new order statuses we requested.

## How I solved this issue:

1. Purpose was to use CF, because of translations, since EVA provided only EN and NL. 
2. Basically made sure that each status corresponds to a good title. This is done in `WimoOrderStatusPage` inside the `getBannerTitle` helper.
