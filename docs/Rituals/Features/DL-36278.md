# DL-36278

## [Redesign | FAQ & WIMO | WIMO Order Status] Content in the banner title should come from CF

## Problems I faced: 

- It was hard to find matching orders. We had to contact EVA so that they can make new orders.
- The `Markdown Component` takes only CF objects, so I had to put a workaround for CF values that we have to combine into one.

## Testing checklist:

1. Home Delivery:

 - When `ORDER_CONFIRMED`, title should be **Hang on, {{name}}, your order is being prepared** GOOD
 - When `ORDER_SHIPPED`, title should be **Almost there. Carrier is on its way!** NO STATUS YET
 - When `ORDER_DELIVERED`, title should be **Package has been delivered. Enjoy!** GOOD

2. Pick up: 

- When `ORDER_CONFIRMED`, title should be **Hang on, {{name}}, your order is being prepared** GOOD
- When `ORDER_SHIPPED`, title should be **You can now pick up your package, name** NO STATUS YET
- When `ORDER_DELIVERED`, title should be **Your order has been picked up. Enjoy!** GOOD

3. Click and collect:

- When `ORDER_CONFIRMED`, title should be **Hang on, {{name}}, your order is being prepared** GOOD
- When `CLICK_COLLECT`, title should be **You can now pick up your package, name** NO STATUS YET
- When `ORDER_PICKEDUP`, title should be **Your order has been picked up. Enjoy!** GOOD
